# Application of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning in E-Commerce
## Predicting Product Taxonomy

Business-to-business or business-to-consumer transactions conducted online is increasing sub-
stantially. Manufacturers and suppliers rely on various sales channels such as an E-commerce
website to gain a market share. E-commerce platforms fetches manufacture’s or supplier’s version of multilingual product information including the products’ taxonomy from the Product Information Management (PIM) systems. Vocabulary used in defining a product taxonomy may differ from
one source to another. In E-commerce platform, mediation of machine learning model to predict
the product taxonomy eases the process of product information deployment.

In this thesis, the author developed a supervised text based classification model to predict the
product taxonomy using open source deep learning framework PyTorch. Author described the
data pre-processing methods, architecture of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), parameter tuning,
model evaluation and deployment. The concepts of neural networks, classification problem and
machine learning process were analyzed from a mathematical point of view.

Initially, research on impact of well-defined product taxonomy on a recommendation system,
virtual agents, Search Engine Optimization (SEO), in an E-commerce was conducted. The concept
of supervised learning and classification methods was presented. Recent developments and research
related to E-Commerce and its reliance on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learn-
ing algorithm were shown. In the following chapters, the step by step implementation of an RNN
based classification model were described. Finally, the model was evaluated using the confusion
matrix.

Comparing the falsely predicted category along with the actual category, indicated some records
were false negative. Meaning the model predicted the category correctly. However, due to prior
human error the actual category itself was incorrectly saved. Author concluded that leveraging
this thesis study with the image based machine learning algorithm to image captioning, image
translation, image classification can generate better product taxonomies.
