\chapter{Impute missing text data}

Machine leaning algorithms requires that their inputs have no missing values.
Missing values encoded as NaNs or blanks are incompatible with estimators which represents as the numerical values and assumes all values have and hold meaning. Discarding the entire row and/or columns of a dataset containing the missing values could lead to losing valuable data. The process to fill (impute) missing values are referred to as imputation.

\subsection{Feature imputation}

In an iterated round-robin fashion, at every step a missing feature column  \textit{y} and other feature columns treated as input \textit{x} predicts the missing values of \textit{y}.
