\chapter{Building a Knowledge graph} \label{sec:building-kg}

Graph-based knowledge representation has been researched for decades.
A \acf{kg} acquires and integrates information into an ontology and applies a reasoner to derive new knowledge \parencite{LisaEhrlinger}.
The knowledge base is a dataset with formal semantics that can contain different kinds of knowledge, for example, rules, facts, axioms, definitions, statements, and primitives \parencite{Davies.2008cop.2006}.

Figure \ref{fig:kg} illustrates the processing of plain text from various sources such as  Wikipedia API, PDF into a graph. This abstract architecture represented by \Citeauthor{LisaEhrlinger} of a \acl{kg} portraits the assumption that a \acl{kg} is more than a \acf{kb}. \acl{kg} is a combination of \acl{kb} and \acf{qe}. 

\Iac{qe} is a set of graph of possible questions that could be formed in reference to \iac{kb}. \acf{qg} for comprehensive reading is a challenging task. There are datasets available for  \acs{qg}, one of it is Stanford Question Answering Dataset v1.0 (SQuAD) consisting of questions posed by crowd workers on a set of Wikipedia articles \parencite{PranavRajpurkar.}. The limitation with such a data set is that these do not contain unanswerable questions. Building a machine learning model when no answer is supported was out of scope of SQuAD objective \parencite{LupeHernandez}.  Study on automatic question generation from an attention-based sequence learning model \parencite{Vaswani.12062017} for  \ac{qg} and investigate the effect of encoding sentence- vs. paragraph-level information \parencite{DuXinya.29042017}, reduces reliance on handcrafted rule based systems.

\section{Fetching text corpus}


An intriguing application of knowledge graphs within the e-commerce industry involves the creation of a comprehensive information network concerning products. Such a knowledge graph can serve as the basis for chatbots to provide answers to user queries. Converting unstructured text corpus into a directed acyclic graph. Knowledge base serve as a foundation for chatbot applications to traverse through the graph structure, locate relevant leafs nodes, and formulate human-readable response. Wikipedia\footnote{https://www.wikipedia.org/} is primarily an encyclopedia with the additional benefit of heavy linking between articles and without the size constraints of paper articles \parencite{TorstenZesch}. 

\section{Knowledge graph with Networkx}

The directed graphs created with Networkx \parencite{hagberg2008exploring} is suitable for representing dependency parsing of a sentence mentioned in section \ref{dependencyparsing}. A knowledge base are represented as triples of \acf{SRO}. In which the subject and object are nodes are entities of a graph and relation are directed edges or links between the nodes.

\subsection*{What to use as nodes n(x) and edges e(y)?}

In table \ref{table:SRO},  triples by  \acs{POS} tags is depicted.

          n(object) & \acs{dobj}    , \acs{pobj}    \\      
          e(relationship) &\acs{adp}, verb  \\

\section{Summary}


In this chapter, using the dependency parsing of an unstructured sentence, building a knowledge graph is proposed.  The process involves textual information on a product from various sources pass through various methods such as dependency parsing, part of speech tagging, named entity relationship mapping. The processed text is created into a directed graph along with the question engine is called the knowledge graph.  

Further research has to be conducted on generating knowledge graph. As per \parencite{LisaEhrlinger}, there are limitations with knowledge graphs as comprehensive reading is a challenging task.
