\chapter{Building a Knowledge graph}

Graph-based knowledge representation has been researched for decades.
A \acf{kg} acquires and integrates information into an ontology and applies a reasoner to derive new knowledge \parencite{LisaEhrlinger}.
The knowledge base is a dataset with formal semantics that can contain different kinds of knowledge, for example, rules, facts, axioms, definitions, statements, and primitives \parencite{Davies.2008cop.2006}.

Figure \ref{fig:kg} illustrates the procsssing of plain text from various sources such as  Wikipedia API, PDF into a graph. This abstract architecture of a \acl{kg} portraits the asumption that a \acl{kg} is more than a \acf{kb}. \acl{kg} is a combination of \acl{kb} and \acf{qe}. 

\Iac{qe} is a set of graph of possible questions that could be formed in reference to \iac{kb}. \acf{qg} for comprehensive reading is a challenging task. There are datasets available for  \acf{qg}, one of it is Stanford Question Answering Dataset v1.0 (SQuAD) consisting of questions posed by crowdworkers on a set of Wikipedia articles \parencite{PranavRajpurkar.}. The limitation with such a data set is that these do not contain unanserable questions. Building a machine learning model when no answer is supported was out of scope of SQuAD objective \parencite{LupeHernandez}.  Study on automatic question generation from an attention-based sequence learning model for  \ac{qg} and investigate the effect of encoding sentence- vs. paragraph-level information \parencite{DuXinya.29042017}, reduces reability on hand crafted rule based systems.

\section{Fetching text corpus}


One of the first things required for \acf*{nlp} tasks is a creating a text corpus.
In linguistics and \acs{nlp}, corpus refers to a collection of texts.
