\chapter{Building \acrfull{kg}}

Graph-based knowledge representation has been researched for decades.
A knowledge graph acquires and integrates information into an ontology and applies a reasoner to derive new knowledge \parencite{LisaEhrlinger}.
The knowledge base is a dataset with formal semantics that can contain different kinds of knowledge, for example, rules, facts, axioms, definitions, statements, and primitives \parencite{Davies.2008cop.2006}.

% One of the first things required for \acrfull*{nlp} tasks is a creating a text corpus.
% In linguistics and \acrshort{nlp}, corpus refers to a collection of texts.
